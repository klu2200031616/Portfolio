# portfolio
A portfolio serves as a visual representation of your skills, achievements, and experience. It's a powerful tool for showcasing your work to potential employers or clients, allowing them to quickly assess your capabilities. A well-curated portfolio can distinguish you from competitors and leave a lasting impression. In today's competitive job market, having a strong portfolio is often essential for securing opportunities in creative fields like design, photography, writing, and more.
In this I have create a portfolio sample only using HTML, CSS.
This is just a frontend of this portfolio. In this project I have only used 5 component, they are:
1. index.html:
     This serves as the main landing page of my portfolio webpage
2. intro.html:
     This page shows the interests, educations, and skill of a person
3. contact me:
     This page contains a form to contact that particular webpage host person
4. skills.html
     This page contains the skill that he/she learnt during the jouney of knwoledge
5. learning.html:
     This page will show the currently learning skills of the person

This is the project I have made when I first completed learning HTML, CSS.
We can make changes according our knowledge.
I hope it will help as a templete for the frontend practice.
